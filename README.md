# Spotify-Trends

**Project Overview:** Spotify-Trends is a data-driven project focused on uncovering insights from Spotify's music streaming data. This project leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BigQuery for scalable data processing and analysis, utilizing Big Data technologies to handle and explore large volumes of music-related information. The aim is to perform statistical analysis on the dataset and identify trends such as popular genres, artist performance, song popularity over time, and user listening behavior patterns.

**Key Features:**

_Data Analysis:_ Using GCP BigQuery to run SQL-based queries on the Spotify dataset, enabling efficient data exploration and discovery of meaningful trends in music streaming.

_Big Data Technology:_This project harnesses the power of Big Data tools to process and analyze large datasets quickly and efficiently, making it ideal for handling Spotifyâ€™s extensive music catalog.

_Cloud Deployment:_ The entire data pipeline and analysis workflows are deployed on GCP to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of access for further analysis.

_Visualization:_ Interactive and insightful data visualizations are created using Google Looker Studio to present key findings. These visuals help uncover trends such as top songs, trending artists, genre distributions, and more.

**Project Goals:**

1. Analyze music streaming patterns and trends using statistical methods.
2. Gain insights into listener preferences and behavior across different regions and time periods.
3. Visualize key metrics such as song popularity, artist growth, and genre shifts over time.
